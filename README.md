# Quarantine

Prologue

In a closed military town somewhere in the north of the country, an unknown infection has broken out — deadly, rapidly spreading, with unpredictable symptoms. The authorities have declared a state of emergency and imposed a strict quarantine. All residents are ordered not to leave their homes. Military personnel in hazmat suits patrol the streets, patrolling neighborhoods and shooting violators.

The main character is an ordinary person living in one of the many panel buildings in the city. He doesn't know what is really happening: whether it's truly an epidemic or something more terrifying. The only connection to the outside world is through televised messages from the local government and occasional deliveries from military couriers. And around him — four walls and a view from the window, where sometimes shadows of people in protective suits flicker by.
